(* RMB 93/10/11 
   This module was missing from the distribution.  I suppose it
   might have been builtin to Mocka and Sun Modula-2, but it is
   apparently not builtin to mtc.  mtc Won't translate General,
   which is a client of this module, without it.  So how did this ever compile
   without it?  Reconstruction done by looking at clients and the
   C version, which appears to be generated by mtc.
