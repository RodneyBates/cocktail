Bnf - Transformer from EBNF to BNF
==================================

The common front-end (FRONT) for bnf, ell, and lalr must have been compiled
before you can generate bnf. As bnf makes use of the library of reusable
Modula-2 modules (MLIB=reuse), this library must also have been compiled before.
It has been compiled successfully on several configurations
using 2 different Modula-2 compilers:

configuration | computer | processor | operating-system | compiler
--------------------------------------------------------------------
MC            | PCS 9900 | MC 68020  | MUNIX m32-1.2    | MOCKA (mc)
MC            | SUN 3    | MC 68020  | SunOS 4.1        | MOCKA (mc)
M2C           | SUN 3    | MC 68020  | SunOS 4.0        | SUN Modula (m2c)
MC            | SUN 3    | MC 68020  | PCTE 1.4		| MOCKA (mc)
MC            | SUN 4    | SPARC     | SunOS 4.1        | MOCKA (mc)
MC	      | VAX 750	 |	     | BSD UNIX 4.2	| MOCKA (mc)
MC	      | VAX 8500 |	     | ULTRIX V2.0-1	| MOCKA (mc)
MC	      | DEC 3100 | MIPS      | ULTRIX V2.0-7	| MOCKA (mc)

To generate bnf use:

   make <configuration> MLIB=... FRONT=...
   make install LIB=... BIN=...
